                <summary>How to play ⤵️</summary>
                <li class="content">Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no use of dice or cards. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. Checkmating the opponent's king involves putting the king under immediate attack <br> <em> (in "check") </em> whereby there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</li>
